# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}

#install packages
install.packages("readr")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("tidyr")
install.packages("stringr")

#load packages
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)


#read the dataset 
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/refs/heads/master/cocktail_data.tsv"
cocktail_data <- read_tsv(url)

#preview the first few rows of the data
head(cocktail_data)


```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}

#extract the 8th column (which contains the ingredients)
ingredients_column <- cocktail_data[[8]]  # Access the 8th column

#clean and separate ingredients
clean_ingredients <- function(ingredients) {
  #split ingredients by <br/>
  ingredient_list <- unlist(strsplit(ingredients, "<br/>"))
  
  #remove measurements, quantities, and non-ingredient terms
  ingredient_list_cleaned <- gsub("\\b\\d+\\b|oz|%|abv|ml|tbsp|bsp|dash|drops?|dashes|br|<>|\\(.*?\\)", "", ingredient_list, ignore.case = TRUE)
  
  #remove extra spaces and empty entries
  #remove any other non-alphabetic characters (but keep spaces between words for multi-word ingredients)
  ingredient_list_cleaned <- gsub("[^a-zA-Z ]", "", ingredient_list_cleaned)
  ingredient_list_cleaned <- trimws(ingredient_list_cleaned)
  ingredient_list_cleaned <- ingredient_list_cleaned[ingredient_list_cleaned != ""]
  
  return(ingredient_list_cleaned)
}

#apply the cleaning function to each ingredient 
cleaned_ingredients <- lapply(ingredients_column, clean_ingredients)

#create a new data frame with each ingredient in a separate row
cleaned_ingredients_df <- cocktail_data %>%
  mutate(ingredients = cleaned_ingredients) %>%
  unnest(ingredients) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = trimws(ingredients))  

#view the cleaned data
head(cleaned_ingredients_df)
cleaned_ingredients_df

print(n=220, cleaned_ingredients_df)

#after reviewing the ingredients I noticed that there are some unnecessary characters that will affect further calculations: "es" inconsistently occuring in "es Angostura bitters", "s" preceding "saline solution", etc. Also, some ingredients were not separated properly: eg. sweet vermouth and orange juice in line 33. 
#removing the remaining unnecessary characters "s" and "es"
cleaned_ingredients_df <- cleaned_ingredients_df %>%
  mutate(ingredients = gsub("\\b(s|es)\\b", "", ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = trimws(ingredients))

#separating ingredients incorrectly placed in the same row
cleaned_ingredients_df <- cleaned_ingredients_df %>%
  #split by multiple spaces or by " or "
  mutate(ingredients = strsplit(ingredients, "\\s{2,}|\\s+or\\s+")) %>%
  #separate the ingredients to place each on a new row
  unnest(ingredients) %>%
  #trim extra spaces
  mutate(ingredients = trimws(ingredients)) %>%
  #remove any empty rows 
  filter(ingredients != "")



#view the cleaned data
head(cleaned_ingredients_df)
cleaned_ingredients_df

print(n=224, cleaned_ingredients_df)

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}

#get ingredients across all cocktails without duplicates 
needed_ingredients <- unique(trimws(gsub("/|\\(.*?\\)|\\b\\d+\\b|oz|%|abv|ml|tbsp|bsp|dash|drops?|dashes|br|\\.", "", cleaned_ingredients_df$ingredients, ignore.case = TRUE)))

#remove any extra spaces
needed_ingredients <- needed_ingredients[needed_ingredients != ""]

#print unique ingredients in alphabetical order 
print(paste("Needed ingredients:", paste(sort(needed_ingredients), collapse = ", ")))

```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}

#count and print needed ingredients (already cleaned from duplicates)
num_needed_ingredients <- length(needed_ingredients)
print(paste("Number of needed ingredients:", num_needed_ingredients))



```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}

#count and arrange the ingredients in a descending order 
top_ingredients <- cleaned_ingredients_df %>%
  count(ingredients) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
#rank the ingredients while assigning the same rank to ties
  mutate(rank = dense_rank(-n)) %>%  
#filter the top 10 ranks, including ties
  filter(rank <= 10)  
#print the result
print(top_ingredients)

```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}

#count the number of ingredients in each cocktail 
ingredient_per_cocktail <- cleaned_ingredients_df %>%
  group_by(name) %>%  
  summarise(ingredient_count = n()) %>%  
  filter(ingredient_count == max(ingredient_count))  #filter cocktail(s) with the most ingredients
#print the result and the added text to give the full answer
for (cocktail in ingredient_per_cocktail$name) {
  print(paste(cocktail, "has the most ingredients."))
}


```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

```{r}

#count the number of cocktails each ingredient appears in
rare_ingredient <- cleaned_ingredients_df %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%  #group by ingredient
  summarise(cocktail_count = n_distinct(name)) %>%  #count the number of coctails each ingredient appears in 
  filter(cocktail_count == 1)  #filter for ingredients that appear in exactly one cocktail

#print to check 
print(rare_ingredient)

#count the number of ingredients that appear in only one cocktail
num_rare_ingredient <- nrow(rare_ingredient)

#print result with additional text
print(paste("Rare ingredients:", num_rare_ingredient))


```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}

#count the number of cocktails each ingredient appears in
rare_ingredient <- cleaned_ingredients_df  %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%  #group by ingredient
  summarise(cocktail_count = n_distinct(name)) %>%  #count the number of coctails each ingredient appears in 
  filter(cocktail_count == 1)  #filter for ingredients that appear in exactly one cocktail

#print to check 
print(rare_ingredient)

#get the names of rear ingredients
rare_ingredient_names <- rare_ingredient$ingredients

#filter the cleaned df for coctails with rare ingredients
coctails_with_rare_ingredients <- cleaned_ingredients_df %>%
  filter(ingredients %in% rare_ingredient_names)  

#get the names of the coctails with rare ingredients
coctail_names_rare_ingredients <- unique(coctails_with_rare_ingredients$name)
#print 
  print(paste("Coctails with rare ingredients:"))
  print(coctail_names_rare_ingredients)


```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}

#identify rare ingredients 
rare_ingredient <- cleaned_ingredients_df %>%
  group_by(ingredients) %>%  #group by ingredient
  summarise(cocktail_count = n_distinct(name)) %>%  #count the number of cocktails each ingredient appears in
  filter(cocktail_count == 1)  #filter for ingredients that appear in exactly one cocktail

#print to check rare ingredients
print(rare_ingredient)

#get names of rare ingredients
rare_ingredient_names <- rare_ingredient$ingredients

#identify cocktails that contain any rare ingredient
cocktails_with_rare_ingredients <- cleaned_ingredients_df %>%
  filter(ingredients %in% rare_ingredient_names) %>%
  distinct(name)

#get the names of cocktails with a rare ingredient
cocktail_names_with_rare_ingredients <- cocktails_with_rare_ingredients$name

#identify cocktails without rare ingredients
cocktails_with_no_rare_ingredients <- cleaned_ingredients_df %>%
  filter(!name %in% cocktail_names_with_rare_ingredients) %>% #exclude cocktails with rare ingredients
  distinct(name)

#get the names of the cocktails without rare ingredients
cocktail_names_no_rare_ingredients <- cocktails_with_no_rare_ingredients$name

#print with text
print("Cocktails with no rare ingredients:")
print(cocktail_names_no_rare_ingredients)

  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

#empty table with  ingredients as columns and cocktails as rows
ingredient_names <- unique(cleaned_ingredients_df$ingredients)
cocktail_names <- unique(cleaned_ingredients_df$name)

#blank data frame
cocktail_ingredient_matrix <- as.data.frame(matrix(
  nrow = length(cocktail_names),
  ncol = length(ingredient_names) + 1  # +1 for the cocktail name column
))
colnames(cocktail_ingredient_matrix) <- c("Cocktail", ingredient_names)
cocktail_ingredient_matrix$Cocktail <- cocktail_names

#put an X in the intersections where a cocktail has an ingredient
for (i in 1:nrow(cocktail_ingredient_matrix)) {
  cocktail_name <- cocktail_ingredient_matrix$Cocktail[i]
  ingredients_in_cocktail <- cleaned_ingredients_df %>%
    filter(name == cocktail_name) %>%
    pull(ingredients)
  
  cocktail_ingredient_matrix[i, ingredient_names %in% ingredients_in_cocktail] <- "X"
}

#replace "no match" cells with blanks
cocktail_ingredient_matrix[is.na(cocktail_ingredient_matrix)] <- ""



#print
print(cocktail_ingredient_matrix)

```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
